# Financial-Fraud-Detection-System

The goal of this project is to build and compare multiple models for fraud detection, evaluate their performance, and provide interpretability using SHAP values to understand key drivers of fraud.

Results

Random Forest emerged as the best-performing model, balancing precision and recall for fraud detection.

Unsupervised methods provided additional anomaly insights, complementing supervised approaches.

SHAP visualizations improved interpretability, helping identify why certain transactions were flagged as fraud.
